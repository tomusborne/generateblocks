A small collection of lightweight WordPress blocks that can accomplish nearly anything.

== Description ==

https://vimeo.com/412896611

Add incredible versatility to your editor without bloating it with tons of one-dimensional Gutenberg blocks. With GenerateBlocks, you can learn a handful of blocks deeply and use them to build anything.

[GenerateBlocks](https://generateblocks.com?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme) works hand-in-hand with [GeneratePress](https://generatepress.com?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=generateblocks-readme), but is built to work with any theme.

Looking for more features? Check out [GenerateBlocks Pro](https://generateblocks.com/pro?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme).

= Container =

Organize your content into rows and sections. The Container block is the foundation of your content, allowing you to design unique sections for your content.

= Grid =

Create advanced layouts with flexible grids. The Grid block gives you the ability to create any kind of layout you can imagine.

= Headline =

Craft text-rich content with advanced typography. Everything from headings to paragraphs - take full control of your text.

= Buttons =

Drive conversions with beautiful buttons.

= Performance =

We take performance seriously. Minimal CSS is generated only for the blocks you need, and our HTML structure is as simple as possible while allowing for maximum flexibility.

= Coding standards =

Built to the highest coding standards for security, stability and future compatibility.

= Fully responsive =

Every block comes with tablet and mobile controls, giving you total control of your responsive design.

= Documentation =

Check out our [documentation](https://docs.generateblocks.com) for more information on the individual blocks and how to use them.

== Installation ==

There's two ways to install GenerateBlocks.

1. Go to "Plugins > Add New" in your Dashboard and search for: GenerateBlocks
2. Download the .zip from WordPress.org, and upload the folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory via FTP.

In most cases, #1 will work fine and is way easier.
